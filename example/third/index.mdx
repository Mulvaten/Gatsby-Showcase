Perhaps the most important part of any website is the data it's displaying. This data can come from many different places, including the filesystem, a database, or a content management system. Gatsby enables all of these disparate sources to be used in conjunction with each other through the use of the data layer. Gatsby pulls data from these sources into its data layer through the use of various plugins, and pulls data out of it (and onto the site) through GraphQL. Much like SQL, Graphql can be used by writing queries to pull only the relevant data onto your page.
