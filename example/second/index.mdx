While Gatsby's built-in functionality is indeed powerful, many use cases require the addition of more advanced features. For this reason, Gatsby allows developers to install plugins to extend its functionality. These plugins range from image processing and filesystem data access, to analytics and e-commmerce. Fortunately, the install process for a Gatsby plugin is quite simple. Just use npm to install it from the terminal, and configure it in the gatsby-config-js file for your application.
